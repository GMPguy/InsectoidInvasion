Source files of Insectoid Invasion.

Insectoid_Invasion_Source_1.0.1 - is the current version. If you want to download source files of the game, download these!
Questionable_Quest_SOURCE - is the legacy version. The reason it's still up, is to prove the game was submissioned before jam's end.

INSTURCTIONS:
- Download all the zip files
- Extract the files, by extracting the main file (the one without Z0, Z1, ..., Z6 in name)
- Open the .mfa file, with Clickteam Fusion 2.5 program (equivelant or better version)

Make sure you have "Layer Object" and "Mosue object", before you open the file!
